# Instructions

Develop a program in the language of your choice that can determine the
greatest common divisor of two integers (whole numbers) and output the result. 

A greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers which are not zero is the
largest positive integer that divides each number exactly.

For example, the GCD of `8` and `12` is `4`, as `2x4 = 8` and `3x4 = 12`.

Once complete, create a branch** called "your_name" (replace "your_name" with
your GitHub username) in the "challenges/gcd/results"** directory in the
DeakinSEC GitHub repo and commit** your program files with an example of the
output. The output example can be either a screenshot or text file.

## Note

Don't clone and work with the DeakinSEC coding-challenges repository directly.
Instead, make a fork, clone your fork, create your branch, commit to your branch
and push to your fork. Once done, send a pull-request in GitHub!
