# Instructions

Develop a program in the language of your choice that can determine the
greatest common divisor of two integers (whole numbers) and output the result. 

A greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers which are not zero is the
largest positive integer that divides each number exactly.

For example, the GCD of `8` and `12` is `4`, as `2x4 = 8` and `3x4 = 12`.

Check out the
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
on gcd.

_Please read the instructions in the
[main README](https://github.com/deakinsec/coding-challenges)
to contribute a solution._
